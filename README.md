The Film Junky Union, an edgy community for classic movie enthusiasts, aims to develop a system that filters and categorizes movie reviews by sentiment. Using a dataset of IMDB movie reviews labeled for polarity, the goal is to build and train a classification model capable of detecting negative reviews. The model must achieve an F1 score of at least 0.85 to meet the project requirements.

Key Objectives:
Develop a robust model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.
Ensure the model achieves an F1 score of at least 0.85 on the test set.
Provide insights into the model's strengths and limitations, along with recommendations for deployment.

Methodology:

Data Preparation:
Load and preprocess the dataset of IMDB movie reviews with polarity labeling.
Clean the text data (e.g., remove stopwords, punctuation, and apply stemming/lemmatization).
Convert the text into numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze the distribution of positive and negative reviews.
Identify common words or phrases in each category.
Explore data imbalances or inconsistencies.

Model Training:
Train multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks) to identify the best-performing approach.
Utilize cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well.

Model Tuning:
Perform hyperparameter optimization to maximize performance.
Evaluate models using the F1 score, with particular focus on precision and recall for negative reviews.

Model Evaluation:
Test the final model on a separate test set to validate its performance.
Analyze precision, recall, F1 score, and potential false positive/negative rates.
